  UIKit is a small collection of flexible, cohesive, decoupled components for the modern web. With an emphasis on (mostly) structure-only styling making it simple to apply application specific styling. UIKit is _not_ a replacement for larger UI frameworks, nor is it a CSS framework such as Bootstrap.
