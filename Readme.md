  UIKit is a small collection of flexible, cohesive, decoupled components for the modern web. With an emphasis on (mostly) structure-only styling making it simple to apply application specific styling. UIKit is _not_ a replacement for larger UI frameworks, nor is it a CSS framework such as Bootstrap.

## Components

  - `ui.Emitter` an event emitter used throughout various components
  - `ui.Card` a double-sided "card" powered by 3d transforms
  - `ui.ColorPicker` an elegant scalable color picker
  - `ui.Dialog` a dialog component sporting optional modal and overlay functionality
  - `ui.Confirmation` a confirmation dialog building on `ui.Dialog`
  - `ui.Notification` an unobtrusive growl-like notification
